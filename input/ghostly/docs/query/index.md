Description: Describes GQL, Ghostly's query language
---

To get the most out of Ghostly, you can use the Ghostly Query Language 
(shortened GQL) to search among your pull request, issues, releases, 
vulnerabilities and commits.

**All queries made with GQL are local and does not require an internet connection.**
